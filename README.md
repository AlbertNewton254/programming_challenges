# Programming Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to selected problems from the book  
**_Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual_**  
by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revilla.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own folder, named according to the chapter and problem title (e.g., `pg_01_01_collatz`, `pg_01_04_lcd_display`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Languages**: C and Java
- **Build System**: Manual compilation
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (tested on Unix-like systems)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Compile and run a C solution:

```bash
cd pg_xx_xx_problem_name
gcc pg_xx_xx_problem.c -o problem
./problem
```bash

### Compile and run a Java solution:

```bash
cd pg_xx_xx_problem_name
javac Main.java
java Main
```bash

🔁 Replace pg_xx_xx_problem_name and filenames accordingly.
